This repository documents hands-on learning through the OverTheWire Bandit wargame, focused on Linux command-line usage and fundamental security concepts.

## OverTheWire – Bandit Wargame (Levels 0–12)

- Practiced Linux commands such as `ls`, `cat`, `cd`, `file`, `find`, `grep`, `base64`, `xxd`, `cut`, `strings`, `gzip`, and `bzip2`
- Worked with hidden files, unusual filenames, symbolic links, and hexdump-encoded files
- Explored file permissions, redirection, and decoding layers (e.g., Base64 → gzip → bzip2)
- Used shell tools to inspect, decode, and reconstruct binary and encoded content
- Gained practical experience in navigating and analyzing file systems securely
- Used a private SSH key to authenticate without a password  
- Connected to the next level via `ssh` using the `-i` option for key-based authentication  
- Understood the use of `localhost` to connect to services running on the same machine
